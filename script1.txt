Tutorial 1: Keras, Basics of Supervised Learning, How is Reinforcement Learning different


Problem solved by Machine Learning in general:
we have some Target Set, and want to create a Model that maps a sample from that set to some "Good" answer.

One way to get there: gradient descent on a labeled dataset

We will supply our Model with examples, consisting of a sample in the same format as in The Target Dataset and a given, "good" answer.
Then we will change all parameters of our model to make it closer to producing such answer on its own.
We will repeat it many times.

Key elements of the scheme:

Model [Neurons, Layers]
Dataset - samples, labels
Good Answer - defining loss function
how: Optimizer - learning rate, momentum, etc., etc.
